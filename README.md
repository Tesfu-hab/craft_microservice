# craft_microservice

In this task I used mysql db for customer and order microservices and postgres db for lead.
In CMS ==> There are api's to create new customer, search customer by customerId, update customer by customerId.
In LMS ==> There are api's to create new lead, convert lead to customer, create new customer and update customer by customerId.
