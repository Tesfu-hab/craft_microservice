# craft_microservice

In this task I used mysql db for customer and order microservices and postgres db for lead.
In CMS ==> There are api's to create new customer, search customer by customerId, update customer by customerId.
In LMS ==> There are api's to create new lead, convert lead to customer, create new customer and update customer by customerId.
In SOMS ==> There are api's to create new order and update order by orderId.

Future plan:
1. Add more services and endpoints
2. Add loadbalance
3. Bidirectional interconnection
4. Add validation and security
5. exception handling
6. Add frontend
